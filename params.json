  "body": "#Project1 Sentence Generator\r\n#Project Request:\r\n  Markovian-tweets, due September 26th. Consume a text file with sentences and produce a tweet (< 145 characters) with the style of the input text. I see several layers of success in this project and encourage you to shoot for the level that best matches your team's abilities: Level 1 does the base Markov Sentence Generation from the sample text. (Google around and you'll find lots of info on this part.) Layer 2 if you've got web skills on your team: Consume a Twitter username and create a sample of that person's tweets, then generate a tweet in their style. Layer 3: Create a bot which accepts username and tweets a message in that user's style.\r\n",
